# Sample R Scripts
### Author: Alexa Rossello

## Overview
This repository contains two sample R scripts that showcase methods for aggregating import data and identifying missing reports within a weekly survey process. The scripts demonstrate techniques for data manipulation, analysis, and reporting.

### **Important Note:**
- The scripts are **not reproducible** due to the removal or anonymization of file names, database repositories, and variables to maintain confidentiality.
- As a result, no actual datasets or live connections are included, and the scripts are provided solely to highlight coding methodologies.

## Description of Scripts

1. **`script1_aggregate_imports.R`**
   - Purpose: Aggregates data from multiple files or sources to generate summaries of import activity.
   - Methods:
     - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
     - Summarization of key metrics.
     - Output generation for downstream processes.
   - Note: The original file paths and table names have been anonymized.

2. **`script2_identify_missing.R`**
   - Purpose: Identifies missing or incomplete reports within a weekly survey process.
   - Methods:
     - Cross-referencing expected versus received data.
     - Generating alerts for missing reports.
   - Note: Certain variables and workflows have been altered for confidentiality.

## Notes on Non-Reproducibility
- **Data Sources**: Data used in these scripts originates from proprietary systems and cannot be shared.
- **File Paths**: Paths to files and databases have been replaced with placeholders.
- **Variable Names**: Field names and table structures have been anonymized to ensure data privacy.
